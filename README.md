# **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Keras with a TensorFlow backend. The model is built step-by-step to perform classification/regression tasks depending on the dataset used. It provides a clear understanding of how deep learning models are constructed, trained, and evaluated in practice.

**Features**

Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling, splitting)

ANN model creation using Sequential API

Compilation with optimizers and loss functions

Training and validation of the model

Model evaluation on test data

Performance visualization (accuracy, loss curves)

Prediction on unseen data

**Technologies Used**
Python

Keras (high-level deep learning API)

TensorFlow (backend for computation)

NumPy, Pandas (data handling and preprocessing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

**Project Workflow**

Building the ANN

Define input, hidden, and output layers using Keras Sequential model

Apply activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, softmax)


Compiling the Model

Optimizer (e.g., Adam)

Loss function (e.g., binary crossentropy / categorical crossentropy / MSE)

Evaluation metric (e.g., Accuracy)

Training the ANN

Fit model on training data

Validate using test set

Evaluation & Visualization

Evaluate accuracy and loss

Plot learning curves

Generate predictions on unseen data
